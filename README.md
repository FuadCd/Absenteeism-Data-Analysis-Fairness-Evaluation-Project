Absenteeism Data Analysis & Fairness Evaluation Project

This project explores student absenteeism via algorithmic fairness using a real-world school dataset (absenteeism.csv). A diagnostic predictive model is built to identify patterns associated with excessive absenteeism and to assess whether predictions differ systematically across demographic groups (age and sex).

The analysis combines data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and logistic regression modeling to evaluate both predictive performance and fairness. Multiple fairness metrics (Demographic Parity, Equal Opportunity, and Error-Rate Disparities) are used to highlight how model behavior can differ across groups. This project emphasizes trade-offs between accuracy and fairness, and examines how fairness metrics fare when demographic information is used directly in predictive systems.

An interactive Tableau dashboard was created to examine absenteeism distributions and high-risk rates across age and sex groups to complement static visualizations. This allows for a visual explanation of the disparities explored, making findings more accessible to stakeholders.
